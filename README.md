# word_length
Word length task


Assumptions:
There is not excessive user of punctuation, other than that coded for
If there are multiple words of the max / min length, the user wants the first occuring word returned. 
For sake of testing, functions will return the longest word in full lower case

To add test cases: 
Copy a self.assertEqual line, enter sentence to test and expected result in the format ('word', length)
